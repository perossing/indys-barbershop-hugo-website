Indy's is a traditional barbershop in Spokane, Washington, located one block from Spokane Falls in the historic late-1880â€™s Dresden building. We offer quality haircuts and fades, hot-towel straight-razor shaves, and beard trims.

Get a haircut or hot-towel shave at an affordable price, check out the antique decor, play a game of billiards, have some good conversation, and enjoy your time with us!
